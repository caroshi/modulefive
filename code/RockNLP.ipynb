      "Sébastien Tellier is still best known in the States as the louche, besunglassed Frenchman whose 2008 album Sexuality layered the electro-disco sound that was big in Paris at the time with thick dollops of a particularly retro kind of theatrical sleaziness distilled from early-VHS-era pornography. But while he certainly excels at the role of the Eurotrash slimeball, he actually has a far broader range than that. A devotee of Serge Gainsbourg, Tellier has inherited the master’s ambitious genre-hopping habit (as well as his arch-Gallic oleaginity), and aside from house-y synthpop he’s recorded Gainsbourg-style baroque pop, slightly skewed takes on contemporary radio pop, an album of piano ballads, and a film score.For his new Confection, Tellier returns to his role as a composer for film in spirit, if not in actual fact, and combines it with Sexuality’s pursuit of bygone erotic aesthetics. Long story short, it sounds like the soundtrack to a 70s French porn movie that, as far as I can tell, doesn’t actually exist.If it did exist, it would probably look a lot like Emmanuelle, the X-rated blueprint that a decade of soft-focus European (or at least “European”) erotica was based on, as well as the highest-grossing French film of 1974. Confection is reminiscient of Emmanuelle’s soundtrack, composed by Pierre Bachelet, which at its most compelling parts combines French pop crooning, 70s soft rock, and syrupy strings in a way that’s nearly as good as any of the movie’s visuals when it comes to evoking a certain luxurious, but seedy, erotic sensibility.“Adieu” opens the album with cloying strings, a swooningly romantic piano, and wordless vocals by a female opera singer, all moving at a decadently slow pace that heavily suggests Vaseline lenses, gratuitous slow-motion, and proudly unmanaged body hair. The music is schmaltzy, tacky stuff, and Tellier piles it on deliriously, reaching for the point where it tips over from simple camp into the realm of the sublimely sleazy, and frequently surpassing it. At a time where musicians from the nether reaches of the electronic music underground all the way to the top of the Hot 100 are pushing an agenda of radical minimalism, Confection is a fantastically decadent album. Most of the songs are festooned with gooey strings, and the ones that aren’t, like the brief solo piano piece “Curiosa\" still ooze melodrama.However decadent as the songs sound, they still pale in comparison to the depravity of the album itself, whose purpose is hard to pin down. While it’s certain to thrill the avid fans who over the years have formed a small cult around vintage porno soundtracks, the average listener’s likely to simply be baffled. It’s not a dance record by any stretch, and there’s really only one track, “L'amour naissant\", meets the accepted standard for an actual pop song, with a drumbeat and vocals and everything.And if Tellier intended it to function as mood music for some kind of retro-Euro-porn sexual encounter, he probably shouldn’t have tossed in a waltz arranged for solo analog synthesizer halfway through—its creepy, circus-like vibe and squelching electronic tones are almost guaranteed to spoil the mood.Confection’s overall theme is indulgence, and there’s nothing more indulgent than an artist using a whole album to explore a personal obsession that only a fraction of his fans will be capable of enjoying. It feels like a very French-pop-star gesture, extravagant and essentially useless, and perversely enjoyable for exactly those reasons.\n",

      "Work felt like work, so Optica-- the fourth LP from Sweden's Shout Out Louds-- takes things a little easier. Recorded over a year and a half and produced by the band (with an assist from Radio Dept. affiliate Johannes Berglund), Optica is warm, expansive, and swimming in strings. Judiciously paced, too: Clocking in just under an hour, there's not a hasty second to be found among these dozen tracks. The Shout Out Louds took their sweet time with Optica, and it shows: the production's richer, more inviting, their movements more deliberate. But the romantic desperation that carried this band's pre-Work output is hard to come by on Optica, an okay enough widescreen synth-pop record with some major urgency issues.Matching the electroid strut of the Flaming Lips' \"Fight Test\" to any major key Cure single, the rousing, skywritten melody under opener \"Sugar\" is easy to get lost in. Current single \"Illusions\" follows, a glimmering New Order tribute destined to pad out dance night playlists in the months to come. Things start to slip around \"Blue Ice\", a swoony New Romantic puddle dripping with lousy puns (\"Blue Ice\" becomes \"blue eyes\" that \"came out of the blue,\" which, well, yikes) and a limp, hushed-for-a-reason melody. Mercifully, Arcade Fire-y corker \"14th of July\" sweeps in to the blood going a bit, but it's only when Adam Olenius starts singing that you'll start seeing red. \"Take me to the room where you grew up,\" he requests, before adding \"I bet it's got a great view/ I bet no one loves you.\"It's a strange moment, maybe Optica's strangest. And while it's not a great line on its own, the sheer abruptness of it all offers a brief but badly needed respite from the synth-dappled serenity that surrounds it. Optica's a pleasant enough record on the whole, but it suffers from a kind of excessive competence: at this point in the game, the Shout Out Louds are seemingly incapable of penning a genuinely lousy tune, but as with Work, they're having some trouble settling on a truly inspiring one. What Pitchfork's Marc Hogan wrote about Work-- \"all innocuous midtempo thrum and vague yearning\"-- seems every bit as applicable here; These songs tend to float along on sturdy but unspectacular melodies, agreeable enough not to send you across the room looking for the pause button but rarely so gripping you'll remember one song by the time the next one gets going.The band's year-and-change in the studio wasn't for naught, and the mostly self-produced Optica proves the Shout Out Louds' worth behind the boards. Every surface on Optica shimmers, and every close listen turns up more spangles to dislodge from your earlobes. But Optica's detail-oriented sonics can't quite make up for some of its big picture deficiencies, imprecise emotions and melodies that feel rounded off at the edges to discourage friction. The Shout Out Louds deserve their propers for bringing a little more color back into their sound in the wake of Work's Dockers-clad drudgery. But, much like its predecessor, Optica's pervasive mildness doesn't give you much to latch onto.\n",

      "Hercules and Love Affair is an amorphous project with a roster that, aside from the group’s mastermind and artistic director Andy Butler, has turned over completely with each of its three albums so far. But its mission has remained consistent throughout: to breathe new life into the sounds and structures of early dance music, particularly the interplay between producer and vocalist that underpinned the genre’s formative years. On the group’s first two records, 2008’s self-titled debut and 2011’s Blue Songs, they accomplished that goal by exploding the tropes of early house music while simultaneously paying fealty to them, resulting in tracks like the quasi-operatic, Antony-led “Blind” that reincarnated the style into ambitiously strange shapes.For The Feast of the Broken Heart, Butler and his team (which this time around includes Viennese house-and-techno revivalists Haze Factory and industrial music stalwart Mark Pistel) color inside the lines a little more than before. If the first two Hercules records were tributes to the dawning era of dance music thirty or so years ago, Feast is more of a flat-out homage. The sounds, the structures, and the entire approach more closely resembles the source material—the propulsive, hard-edged descendant of disco that pioneers like Larry Levan were spinning in the '70s and '80s. Having spent years deconstructing old house music, Butler's now become a considerably more faithful and accurate emulator.There are drawbacks to any artistic undertaking with an explicit retro-revivalist agenda, and Feast suffers accordingly—in particular, there's the subtle but ever-present sensation that, for all the excitement that the music generates, it’s still an echo of someone else’s good time that happened decades ago. Butler and company mitigate much of that feeling by giving their influences a sonic touch-up, dirtying and tweaking out the vintage drum machine and synthesizer sounds they’re working with (check the noisy synth that puts an intriguing wrinkle into the smooth lines of “My Offence”), in the process infusing them with a wily energy that more fastidious retro reproductions can’t manage. Hercules and Love Affair give these tracks more room to breathe than the sometimes claustrophobically compact arrangements on older house records.To some extent, The Feast of the Broken Heart bounces back against those drawbacks because of the nature of the style Hercules and Love Affair working in. Compared to the other major pop genres, dance music has historically been immune to the effects of nostalgia because it’s spent so much of its existence, at least in America, as a subcultural style with an audience that’s been removed from the mainstream (partly because it’s been so relentlessly forward-looking from the genre's beginnings). The recent arrival of younger rave revivalists and old-school house fanatics, however, has caused the genre as a whole to take a good look at its past and try, in earnest, to replicate it.Like Hercules’s first two records, Feast transcends mere homage not only through sonic innovations but by the quality of the emotional connection it makes with its audience. Butler is both a gifted producer and a crafty A&R, and throughout the album he fits an unexpected cast of singers to songs based on criteria much more subtle and significant than their vocal range. The stage performer Rouge Mary imparts disco-diva uplift to the self-realization anthem “5:43 to Freedom”, elevating a hokey line like “Be yourself/ Like there ain’t nobody” into something that could genuinely inspire a dancefloor epiphany. On “My Offence”, singer-songwriter Krystle Warren, whose own work normally leans towards rootsy chamber pop, brings a raspy low range and gleaming high range with the same kind of casual fuck-you attitude that's similarly animated other statement-of-identity house tracks offering spiritual solace to several generations of club-going social misfits.The album’s emotional and musical peak comes with “I Try to Talk to You”, featuring alt-folk singer and former Czars front man John Grant. It’s about Grant’s experience finding out he’s H.I.V. positive, and knowing that about the song can make it a gutting listen, especially on the choruses where he crooningly pleads, “I don’t understand, help me please.” But instead of backing him up with a dirge, Butler and his crew give him a raucous, thumping floor-filler. To some, combining lyrics about a potentially life-threatening illness with the gaudy synthesized orchestral stabs the track’s festooned with might seem crass, but it’s exactly this refusal to bow to tragedy that kept the original house music scene alive through the ravages of the AIDS crisis. With it, Hercules & Love Affair tap into an essential part of house music’s history that’s far more profound than just the music.\n",

      "Long live the singers who never intended to be singers; they're the ones that make you feel like there are still new ideas under the sun. Life Without Buildings were a short-lived, mathy art-rock band from Glasgow fronted by a painter/sometimes-spoken-word poet named Sue Tompkins, who ended up in a band almost by accident and sang like a kindergarten playground bully reciting her older sibling's copy of Horses from memory. No one since has sounded quite like Life Without Buildings, and to even try would miss the point. Their music valued invention, risk, wonder, imagination, and—perhaps above all other virtues—fun. And like very few bands, they were smart enough to walk away as soon as the fun stopped. \"When the band began of course none of us really thought anyone would be interested, so there wasn't anything at stake,\" guitarist Robert Johnston recalled about a decade after their amicable break-up. \"For Sue, I think it turned from a laugh into being a commitment she'd never signed up for.\" Lucky for us, though, that laugh was caught and forever immortalized on tape.Released on Rough Trade's Tugboat imprint in 2001, Any Other City is Life Without Buildings' only proper record. (There's also the very good live album, Live at the Annandale, which was released in 2007, a few years after the band broke up.) It came out to mild hype but has grown to be a cult favorite in the years since, its reputation all the more storied and elusive because the CD went out of print and it has never been available on vinyl in the U.S. until now. That the band has yet to capitalize on the reunion show/deluxe-reissue trend keeps with the lack of careerist tendencies that defined its entire run. There's a story that, in 2001 at what would end up being the Strokes' first-ever headlining show in London, Life Without Buildings got bumped down to a supporting act at the last minute. Even if it's apocryphal, I suspect this tale gets repeated by fans so often because it cements LWB's underdog status—their indifference about jumping through the hoops that would have made them the Next Big Thing and the inability of most people to appreciate them in their time. Reviews of Any Other City were either breathless raves or pans that questioned the sanity of anyone who could listen to it in full. \"I remember one [review] that said only mad people could like us,\" drummer Will Bradley said years later. \"I was happy with that. Not long afterwards, we seemed to get a lot of guys coming to our gigs with fresh head wounds, like unstitched lobotomy scars.\"The most distinct (or to those who prefer the safety of convention, the \"maddest\") part of Life Without Buildings' sound is Tompkins' singing, which lands somewhere between scatting, talking, and speaking in tongues. \"No details, but I'm gonna persuade you!\" she insists with electric charisma in the record's first seconds, and opening-line mission statements do not get much truer than that; all you'll want to do for the next 45 minutes is follow her blindly, even when you don't know where the hell she's headed. To Tompkins, language is bubblegum—something exhilaratingly sugary to chomp, crack, and stretch between her fingers. In that opening song, \"P.S. Exclusive\", she repeats the phrase \"the right stuff\" 44 times, but it's too dynamic to ever grow repetitive; it's almost like she's playing a game with herself to see all the different ways she can pronounce it.Tompkins' lyrics often resemble collages. Familiar words are stammered, stuttered, and chopped up until they sound disorienting and strange—which is a sensibility that carries over to the visual art she's been making since she left the band. (A line from the program of one of her recent gallery shows could easily double as a description of a Life Without Buildings song: \"Through her typed and spoken works she represents snatches of material gleaned from the everyday, distorting meaning by metering their arrangement and delivery.\") She delights in found phrases, homophones, and the serendipity misunderstanding. In fan favorite \"The Leanover\", she chants \"If I lose ya, if I lose ya, if I lose ya in the street\" enough for it to start sounding like \"if Illusion Street.\" Or something else entirely. On the song's entry on SongMeanings.net, there is a long comment written by someone who was once convinced that she was saying \"a Fallujan street\" and that the song was about the Iraq War. Although this theory has been debunked, I have no doubt that this poetic misunderstanding would delight Sue Tompkins.For all its art-rock leanings, Any Other City never feels too self-indulgent. A lot of this has to do with the interplay between Tompkins' freewheeling style and the dependable (though wonderfully crooked) backbone provided by Johnston, Bradley, and bassist Chris Evans. Inspired by Pittsburgh math-rock heroes Don Caballero, Life Without Buildings were first an instrumental band before they convinced their art-school friend Tompkins to meld her spoken-word poetry with their antic, skittering sound. (Even the band itself is a kind of collage.) Sometimes the disconnect in their sensibilities is a little too wide (the tonal palette of \"Young Offenders\", the most overtly Don Caballero-esque, is a bit too dull for Tompkins' bold, primary-color exclamations), but more often it creates a novel and unique energy. One of the band's signature songs is \"New Town\", in which Johnston's quiet, steadily chugging riff and Bradley's muted beat suddenly explode alongside Tompkins' vocals in the chorus. \"Looking in your eyes/ I'm looking in your eyes!\" she shouts, as combative as she is jubilant, issuing these words like a challenge for everybody else to look, live, and love a little bit more emphatically. The reissue mostly leaves the original record to speak for itself. The only extra included here is a 7\" containing the more ramshackle original versions of \"The Leanover\" and \"New Town\", which are interesting because they let you hear Tompkins working out phrasings and pronunciations she'd sharpen on the record. When Any Other City came out, most people assumed her vocals were heavily improvised, but as the spot-on renditions replicated on Live at the Annandale Hotel proved, they're actually carefully metered and display an extraordinary sense of rhythm. Life Without Buildings were most impressive—and influential—in the way they balanced sheer technical skill with a sense of ecstatic playfulness, which is a sensibility carried on after them by bands like Ponytail, Perfect Pussy, Marnie Stern, Los Campesinos!, and more. Hopefully this reissue will add more names to that list.It's hard to talk about Tompkins' vocals without using the word \"childlike\", which is too often an annoying cliché people use to infantilize female vocalists and refrain from taking them seriously. (Many of the 2001 pans of Any Other City are tainted with sexism; in one baffling comparison, an NME reviewer faulted Tompkins for not sounding like Whitney Houston.) Here, though, it's apt. This record is all about the wild wisdom of youth; here are four musicians who have managed to recreate that sense of wonder and invention and play that most people (and, let’s face it, bands) lose when they get older. “Look around!” Tompkins insists. “Just information in the leaves, in the leaves, in the leaves!” The phrasing is a little awkward, like an expression stammered out before you knew the proper rules of grammar, or a big word uttered before you knew how to pronounce it right. But who cares. If the sound doesn’t exist, she seems to be saying, invent it. Which is exactly what Life Without Buildings did.\n",

      "It's impressive what Russian Circles can do with a basic guitar, bass, and drum setup. There are plenty of metal-leaning instrumental bands who dial up big climaxes, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that creates such an array of textures and emotions with so little. Bassist Brian Cook also uses keyboards, and on the Chicago trio's excellent fifth album, Memorial, they bring in guest cello and violin. But the core, buttressed by imaginative arrangements and strong compositional skills, is strong enough that there would be more than enough chills without these add-ons.The collection follows 2011's Empros. That was a strong effort, too; the eight tracks here, though, feel more polished and fluid, bigger and yet somehow more intimate—even though the pristine recording, again by longtime producer Brandon Curtis, also fits well with the vast, mountainous cover art. Empros had a swing to it, a groove that bled between tracks even when they got darker or heavier. Memorial offers more pronounced dynamics in both directions—the metal moments frenzied, the quiet parts somber and restrained—and instead of offering a push or pull, it goes for higher star-melting theatrics. In that regard, you'd have to place them in the company of Explosions in the Sky, another band that can create compelling narratives without words.Russian Circles do seem to be telling a story here. The clean guitars and strings on brief opener \"Memoriam\" make it feel like a eulogy, and the remaining songs offer the various emotions that come with loss (anger, panic, nostalgia, pain). \"Memoriam\" is an airy piece that jarringly shifts into the heavy, lurching \"Deficit\", an almost seven-minute track that, like \"Mladek\" on Empros, shows you that they have no trouble breaking into a black metal blur. They conjure the Fucking Champs and go explosion-for-explosion with the aforementioned post-rock titans.It's followed by the longest and best song on the album, the seven-and-a-half minute \"1777\". This piece opens with loud, crisp drums that are reminiscent of early Tortoise—John McEntire locking into a groove for a snare-drunk 20 minutes. Cascading guitars and a steady bass circle it, adding a sense of flight to the grounded beats. The dynamics here are reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, who also balance darkness and muck with a sense of the sublime. The slow-motion crescendo at the five-and-a-half-minute mark, the additional layers of spiraling guitars, and chaotically controlled drums could build for another hour and not get boring.You don't get anything that great on the rest of the album; that said, it's an emotional peak you only need to reach once on a collection like this, and the restraint on the following tracks helps with the overall thematic. For instance, the somber, melancholic \"Cheyenne\" is a doomier, more spacious and cinematic song, like 2013 Earth collaborating with Mogwai. The mathy \"Burial\" is heavier, angrier, and complete with pick slides. This may be the album's real climax, at least mentally—during it, you're thinking about the suffocation in death, and not the release. It feeds into the romantic, ethereal \"Ethel\" and the rocker, \"Lebaron\". On Memorial, the more they move away from the straight-up rock moments and into more ambitious constructions, the stronger it feels.The collection closes with vocals from labelmate Chelsea Wolfe on \"Memorial\". It's a chilly, pretty piece that, like the opener, adds a softness to the record, along with a sonic and thematic echo. Wolfe, whispering and layered, sounds great per usual, but her vocal turn confirms something important: Unlike a bunch of bands who opt to go it without a singer, these guys really don't need one.\n",

      "Taking the long view, Seek Magic strikes me as a great album made by someone who really doesn't care much for the format. It's understandable since Dayve Hawk's prior gig Hail Social released a couple of LPs of timely, danceable indie rock while perpetually hemmed in between positive notice (SPIN Band of the Day, a deal with Polyvinyl) and a legitimate breakthrough. I can't imagine being too enthusiastic for the obligations of the traditional album cycle after all of that. Hawk's subsequent release of singles, remixes, and other one-offs under a clutch of confusingly similar names (Memory Tapes, Weird Tapes, Memory Cassette) announced his newfound artistic direction as a cry of freedom, and he didn't show much interest in performing live either. But more eyes are on him than ever for Player Piano, and he's still got a thing for demurral. He's already claimed his third record to be almost done, allegedly a collection of Black Sabbath-influenced dirges. You would think such diffuse focus would eventually catch up with him, yet Player Piano finds him more concentrated and economical than ever. Unfortunately, it comes off more like complacency than conviction, that Hawk's either holding back on us, misreading his true strengths, not recognizing the need to rise to the occasion, or possibly all three.While the individual songs on Seek Magic were excellent themselves, what made that record stand out was its comprehensiveness. Whether you enjoyed Hawk's laconic and fuzzy melodies, gelatinous electronic textures, or pulsating dance music, you weren't too far from any of those at a given time (and you could find them all on \"Bicycle\"). Player Piano lacks that crucial cumulative effect, and instead Hawk presents himself more as an able if indistinct singer-songwriter than a molder of pure sound. And it isn't any sort of reactionary statement against chillwave: He stood out in my mind as the most forthright vocalist of his peers to begin with, his feminized coo relying more on elegant melodic curvature than foggy evocation.He gets a proper showcase with single \"Wait in the Dark\", on which Hawk is a true frontman rather than a texture over a streamlined arrangement. This shift makes Memory Tapes successfully come off like a sleek rock band than a home-bound project. Though he's comfortable doing true pop music, as opposed to pop determined by immediate context, his more extroverted moments can be as cloying: \"Sunhits\" rousts Player Piano from a mid-record plateau, but the overly chipper guitar doodles and Hawk's dodgiest and most clearly enunciated hook (\"Nothing's a dream if you never wake up\"-- he's never been a lyrics guy) strain too hard to fulfill the prophecy of its title. And how \"Today Is Our Life\" hits me depends almost entirely on my current mood: There are times when I find it to be a genuinely buoyant tambourine-shaking shimmy of breathless hooks; there are others where that cornpone guitar solo and sitar-laced coda are the stuff of shopping mall karaoke booths.It cuts to what's really troubling about Player Piano, how such a committed studio geek like Hawk delves into production-intensive 60s sunshine pop and ends up with such a weirdly distracting 2-D sound that leaves it sounding unfinished, demo-level, even. Its mood lighting is similar to that of Seek Magic, but the underlying instrumentation is often flat and airless, sucked dry of his typically evocative detailing. Paradoxically, the tracks that are proudly sample-free and reliant on acoustic instrumentation are the ones that are the least dynamic and eerily evoke the disembodied artificial intelligence of keyboard presets. \"Yes I Know\" submerges its carnivalesque pinwheels and Hawk's vocals in a waterlogged muffle that you expect to lift at some point, but it goes relatively hi-fi still without coming up for air. The same goes for \"Offers\" and \"Worries\", nice enough experiments in bubblegum funk and digitally retouched Nuggets Farfisa-rock that lack any sort of immersion or fluidity. And the instrumentals no longer feel like they're on equal footing, not that they do much to make themselves noticed. \"Humming\" is a palate cleanser of skittering drum machines and languid atmosphere begging for a longer work to play a part in, and while the first half of \"Fell Thru Ice\" finds Hawk exploring newly unmoored song structure, Part II is simply a lesser replay of Seek Magic tricks. It gets chased with \"Trance Sisters\", which deserves some credit as a buzzer-beating freak-out of maximalism, even if it's basically a compressed version of \"Bicycle\".All of which makes Player Piano a curiosity more than a flop. In fact, the sturdy hooks and thin arrangements make it ripe for remixes, and considering the similar wavelength he was on with Andorra, I wonder what Dan Snaith might be able to do with the raw materials here. But while I'd love to say Hawk's ear for melody or texture is what differentiates Player Piano from the dozens of agreeable but wholly unremarkable electro-pop records that get a pass, truth is, it's ultimately the comparison to Seek Magic that makes it such a letdown.\n",

      "\"Is it safe for the cowards to do what they've already done?\" It's a rhetorical question, of course, but coming from the well-bearded mouth of Stephen McBean, the sentiment is especially pointed. For in his 10-plus years of making music, McBean has never been one to retrace his steps, venturing outward from the dirgey folk-rock of Jerk With a Bomb to the ever mercurial noise-pop of Pink Mountaintops and the earthquaking boogie of his most successful outfit to date, Black Mountain. But even the popular perception of Black Mountain as 1970s-style riff-mongers is unfairly myopic, with the seeming anomalies in their discography-- the carefree jangle pop of \"No Satisfaction\", the hypno-drone trance of \"No Hits\", or the raised-lighter sing-along \"Stay Free\"-- proving just as prevalent as the Black Sabbath worship. In their heart of hearts, Black Mountain are really just peaceful hippies, but ones who aren't afraid to deploy heavy artillery to assert and protect their way of living. (Run their hearts around at your own risk: If their philosophy could be displayed on a VW microbus bumper sticker, it would read \"Make Love Then War.\")On the band's third album, Wilderness Heart, there's a more concerted effort to reconcile the band's inner darkness and light, a symbiosis reflected in their choice of producers: Randall Dunn, best known for his work with doom-metal giants Boris and Sunn O))), and D. Sardy, whose lengthy list of multi-platinum clients includes Oasis and the Rolling Stones. Couple those big-name producers with the decision to record in L.A., not to mention their mainstream toe-dip on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack, and all signs point to Wilderness Heart's being Black Mountain's go-for-broke commercial bid. But while the new album is certainly more streamlined and luminous than 2008's weighty, apocalyptic In the Future-- no 17-minute prog-rock suites to be had here-- the sharper focus doesn't dilute the band's cannabis-clouded cool.In FM-radio terms, Wilderness Heart is Black Mountain's Houses of the Holy, an album that shimmers as much as it bulldozes, humors as much as it rages, while flexing a more pronounced pop sensibility that mostly works in the band's favor rather than to their detriment. And just as John Paul Jones' Mellotron-based set piece \"No Quarter\" was arguably the highlight of Houses, Wilderness Heart's most striking moments come courtesy of keyboardist Jeremy Schmidt-- his thick, Deep Purplish tones on the Camaro-rattling \"Old Fangs\" prove heavier than the glam-metal riff chugging underneath it, and instead of dropping in the de rigueur guitar solo, the band lets him slather on dreamy layers of laser-beam synth drones. Likewise, his Mellotronic backdrops on the stoner-folk reveries \"Radiant Hearts\" and \"Buried by the Blues\" refashion these downcast acoustic interludes in a more majestic light.Schmidt's spotlight turns are indicative of a broader shift in Black Mountain's M.O., where the band is becoming less reliant on a monolithic power-chord attack and playing more to the strengths and subtleties of its individual members. Sure, Wilderness Heart boasts Black Mountain's fiercest thrasher to date in \"Let Spirits Ride\"-- which takes the proto-speed-metal riff of Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\" for a joyride-- but the real revelation is the playfully loose, stutter-grooved \"The Hair Song\", which despite being built upon contorted acoustic-guitar strums and slides, hits as hard as anything else in the band's canon. The song also charts the increasing confluence of McBean and Amber Webber's voices-- where they were initially presented as stark contrasts, the two are now practically finishing each other's sentences. And in some cases, Webber even steals the song from de facto frontman McBean, her chorus turn on \"Rollercoaster\" elevating the track out of its sludgy morass.For an album that presents a more assured, swaggering Black Mountain, it's a minor disappointment that Wilderness Heart doesn't so much climax as gradually wind down, without a show-stopping finale to crown the victory lap. But even in their quietest moments, the band can still leave you unsettled-- the closing track may be the first Black Mountain acoustic ballad dedicated to a girl, but not coincidentally it's a name (\"Sadie\") strongly evocative of the Manson murders and the tenuous line between blissful, free-loving hippiedom and violent anarchy. And as the song fades out into an ominous tribal-stomp procession, you're still not sure which side Black Mountain are going to lean toward next.\n",

      "Two opinions that could just about pass for facts upon the arrival of Klaxons’ third LP Love Frequency: 1. For many people, particularly in America, hearing the name “Klaxons” immediately opens a time warp back to the DayGlo nights of 2007, when terms like “nu-rave” and “blog-house” were spoken with straight faces and a lack of impunity. 2. It is 2014 now, and Klaxons have made a new album that, quite frankly, is pretty darn boring. However, the second fact is not a direct result of the first—this is correlation, not causation, and even if the terminology and fashion of “nu-rave” hasn’t aged well, its mission to present the 24 hour party plan of rave within a rock band context is as old as rave itself. Besides, Justice still packs 'em in, Simian Mobile Disco has become a bankable live act, and who knows, maybe something good will come of the New Young Pony Club rebranding. So Love Frequency's failures aren’t derived from a lack of currency, but rather a lack of identity.And that’s an odd issue to have with Klaxons, who put a lot of effort into establishing their previous guise, affixing the prolix lyrics and dubious mysticism of prog onto taut, glowstick-waving pop songs. It proved surprisingly malleable as they made a nu-rave-to-nu-metal transition from their electro-shocked debut to the Ross Robinson-produced Surfing the Void. It’s understandable they’d want to expand: after all, both Myths of the Near Future and Surfing the Void were enjoyable, but also top-heavy and ephemeral. Yet, while Jamie Reynolds alludes to a biblical vision quest on “Rhythm of Life”, the Klaxons return from their 40 days and 40 nights in exile (or, more, accurately, four years) having taken on perhaps the single-most common form of non-American dance-rock hybrids: that of “Don’t Fight It, Feel It” shamanism. The song titles could pass for Madchester Successories—“Children of the Sun”, “A New Reality”, “Invisible Forces”, “There is No Other Time”. Just by scanning the tracklist, you know what to expect.Beyond the lack of imagination, Love Frequency is a baggy record regardless of which definition you prefer, whether it’s hearkening to “Loose Fit” or just the way their previously punchy hooks have been swapped out for paunchy beats. Synthesized drums bang with almost no variation for up to five minutes at a time, an introductory chorus explains the song’s title before shifting to a custodial, time-killing verse—and then it returns in time to remind you which song is “Show Me a Miracle” and which one is “Invisible Forces”. It’s pointless to quote the lyrics at length, not because they’re ridiculous, but because they’re not ridiculous enough to generate the kind of conviction you need to pull this stuff off. Reynolds sings, “We’re the masters of distraction/ In a time of hyperaction” on “A New Reality”, and it's unclear as to whether Klaxons want to be part of the problem or part of the solution, or whether they have any idea of what they’re trying to get across.Though a coterie of name producers were involved here—Chemical Brother Tom Rowlands, James Murphy, and Erol Alkan—their contributions are imperceptible here without the credits at hand. You could wager a guess by way of the songs' individual tempos and when the rhythms are cranked, Love Frequency is at least enjoyable in a functional way. And maybe functionality and depersonalization is the endgame. Klaxons aspire for elemental sentiments by using elemental imagery—qualities available to everyone and belonging to nobody, not the least of all Klaxons. The sawtoothed synths on opener “A New Reality” and the curious Earth, Wind & Fire harmonies throughout are brief allusions to the fact that you are listening to a Klaxons album and not any number of E-popping revivalists. Otherwise, there’s barely any trace of Klaxons on Love Frequency, and that's a strange complaint when the best songs here are the ones where the band come closest to disappearing completely, as on instrumental “Liquid Light” and the muted, distant shuffle of “The Dreamers”.  Love Frequency isn’t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste Klaxons aren’t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore. At its worst, it’s the kind of hi-BPM, lo-IQ, alt-electro inanities that are responsible for filling the lineup of KROQ's Weenie Roast and will make you seriously reconsider your position on Coldplay and Avicii’s “A Sky Full of Stars”.  For the most part, Klaxons spend most of their time in between, a frequency stuck between stations.\n",

      "If you include the soundtrack album he recorded for Into the Wild, Ukulele Songs is only Eddie Vedder's second solo album. Considering the size and devotion of his cult, coupled with Pearl Jam's \"No, you really shouldn't have\" over-generosity when it comes to releases, it's remarkable he hasn't put out five by now. This makes Ukulele Songs even more of a curiosity: As its title makes clear, the album consists of 16 tracks of Vedder pawing the tiny, four-stringed Hawaiian instrument and warbling love songs. That's it. In a way, it's as clear-cut a proposition as you're going to get these days. You either instantly know you need 35 minutes of this in your life or are already backing slowly away.The songs themselves date back, in some cases, 10 years or more-- presumably from around the same time Vedder wrote \"Soon Forget\", the two-minute ukulele ditty from Binaural. The rest of the songs occupy that same headspace. They are casual, sweet, and disarmingly unaffected, and you can practically smell the campus green wafting off them. That Vedder is putting Ukulele Songs out during this Big Blowout Year of Pearl Jam (Documentary! Festival! Reissue! Tour!) makes it seem even less of a solo project and more like a a souvenir for longtime Pearl Jam fans. It works best that way.Indeed, in small doses, Ukulele Songs is lovely. Vedder has always been affecting when he's lovelorn, and here he's more or less curled up in a ball of bewildered hurt. \"As I move myself out of your sight/ I'll be sleeping by myself tonight,\" he croons on \"Sleeping By Myself\". The album's best moments-- \"Sleeping By Myself\", \"Without You\", \"Longing to Belong\"-- tap the same quietly wounded melancholy as Paul McCartney's 1971 proto-indie pop masterpiece Ram.Alas, 34 minutes is a perilously long time for most to to spend  alone with just Eddie Vedder, a ukulele, and his feelings for company. Vedder's precious side has never been his best one (see: No Code's \"Sometimes\"), and Ukulele Songs is so determinedly twee and relentlessly self-effacing that it can feel like watching a grown man attempting to morph into a baby koala before your eyes. By itself, hearing Chan Marshall playing Bernadette Peters to Vedder's Steve Martin for the duet \"Tonight You Belong to Me\" is winning and funny; in the context of a full ukulele album, it is slightly cloying. Vedder has said he wants this record to inspire people to pick up the instrument and sing with their friends, an old-fashioned sentiment impossible not to be charmed by. Like a lot of Vedder's experiments, the spirit is easier to admire than the final product. The ukulele might be a great campfire instrument, but sometimes what works best at the campfire should stay there.\n",

      "When Jamie Thompson and Nick Diamonds started their second post-Unicorns collaboration-- the first was Th' Corn Gangg, remember?-- it made perfect sense that they should call it Islands. With breezy calypso rhythms, honeyed country-acoustic guitars, bubbly/silly synthesizer effects, and summery melodies, their debut, Return to the Sea, was a wonderful getaway soundtrack, obscuring its death-haunted lyrics with bright arrangements and rich, coconut-scented production. On Islands' second album, however, storm clouds descended: Arm's Way found the band down a member-- Thompson amicably departed before its recording-- yet ballooned into a six-piece, and the bloat was audible. Melodies (previously the shivery highlight of their songs) were buried in meandering guitar solos, baroque, melodramatic strings, and gloomy, silvery keyboards for a dark, proggy effect that bled the band of much of its fun and levity.The good news is that the clouds seem to have parted; on their third album, Islands are sunny once more.   Perhaps it's due to the return of Thompson, back in the fold after his one-album hiatus, or just a product of stripping the instrumentation down to its most basic structure (in many cases, just synths, drums, and guitar) in service of memorable tunes, but Islands have made a welcome return to form. While those hoping for Return to the Sea's Afro-Caribbean flourishes and guest rappers will be disappointed, Vapours' comparably spare synth-pop is replete with the juicy hooks and major-key bounce that were so lacking from their last effort.The album kicks off with \"Switched On\"'s repetitive shimmying guitar figure, squishy 1980s synths, and swooning, hiccuping vocals. The title track struts like a peacock, showing off a big, swaggering chorus (\"It's the bassline in your mind/ It's a sexy way to cry/ You know I've had my share of doubt/ Until I saw the vapours in your eyes\") over a four-on-the-floor stomp and brassy, confident horns. And \"Tender Torture\" is not only the most lyrically literal interpretation of Islands' earlier beachy ethos but also, with its whirring suction-cup synth effects and gooey \"ooohs,\" the apex of their futuristically sweet sound. That's not to say Islands have given up their penchant for darkness-- after all, we're talking about guys whose main lyrical concerns have long been bones and ghosts. Moody numbers-- like \"No You Don't\" with its spare percolating keyboards and lyrics that warn, \"Don't buy dope from a man you don't know\"-- still abound. But built as they are on tightly wound mechanical beats and free of rococo arrangements, these murkier moments feel more visceral for their restraint.What made Islands' debut so thrilling (and saved Arm's Way from its grandiose ambitions) was the expansive, creative way they wrapped up their classic pop hooks in unexpected instrumentation or imaginative production. And Vapours, though more stripped down than either of its predecessors, continues in that tradition. Surely, many criticisms of the album will include a mention of Islands' Auto-Tuned \"Heartbeat\", but with organic, galloping guitars and whimsical synth flourishes underscoring their most vulnerable vocal melody, Diamonds' mechanized voice adds a dash of synthetic style and keeps things from devolving into the realm of the overly sentimental.   Though there is an overall whiff of the 1980s about Vapours, it sidesteps the traps of either sounding trendily vintage or indistinguishable from the rest of today's Reagan-era impostors. It works best, however, to think of the album as a return to Return to the Sea, only, as its title suggests, in a hazier, less opaque form. It's as if that album's liquid-y tracks have evaporated, leaving only wispy traces of synthesizer melodies and quirky pop choruses wafting through the air.\n",
